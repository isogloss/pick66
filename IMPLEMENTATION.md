# Pick6 Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

Pick6 is a complete OBS Game Capture clone specifically designed for FiveM with the following features:

### ✅ Core Requirements Met

1. **OBS Game Capture Functionality**: Real-time screen capture using Win32 GDI APIs
2. **UI with Projection Control**: Interactive console-based UI with full menu system
3. **Borderless Fullscreen Projection**: Native Win32 borderless window implementation
4. **Resolution & Settings Configuration**: Configurable FPS (up to 120), resolution scaling, hardware acceleration
5. **Real-time Frame Projection**: No recording - pure real-time projection like OBS
6. **FiveM-Specific**: Auto-detection of 10+ FiveM process variants and versions
7. **Single Loader**: Self-contained 87MB executable with no injection required

### 🏗️ Architecture

```
Pick6.Launcher.exe (Main executable - 87MB self-contained)
├── Pick6.Core (Capture engine & FiveM detection)
├── Pick6.UI (Interactive console interface)
└── Pick6.Projection (Borderless fullscreen window)
```

### 🚀 Usage Modes

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
Pick6.Launcher.exe
# Shows full menu with 8 options including scan, capture, project, configure
```

**Automated Mode:**
```bash
Pick6.Launcher.exe --auto-start  # Auto-detect and start everything
Pick6.Launcher.exe --fps 30 --resolution 1920 1080
```

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Process Detection**: Automatically finds FiveM processes (FiveM, FiveM_b2060, CitizenFX, etc.)
- **Real-time Capture**: 60 FPS default, configurable up to 120 FPS
- **Borderless Projection**: True fullscreen borderless window (like OBS fullscreen projector)
- **Configuration**: FPS, resolution scaling, hardware acceleration toggle
- **Cross-platform Build**: Builds on Linux, targets Windows for execution
- **Single File**: No installation, no dependencies, no injection

### 🛠️ Technical Details

- **.NET 8**: Modern, high-performance runtime
- **Win32 GDI**: Direct window capture using BitBlt for low latency
- **Native Window Creation**: Direct Win32 API calls for borderless projection
- **Multi-threaded**: Separate threads for capture and rendering
- **Memory Optimized**: Proper frame disposal and memory management

### 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
├── Pick6.Core/          # GameCaptureEngine, FiveMDetector, Win32 APIs
├── Pick6.UI/            # Console interface and user interaction
├── Pick6.Projection/    # BorderlessProjectionWindow, rendering
└── Pick6.Launcher/      # Main entry point and orchestration
```

### 🔧 Build Output

- **Primary**: `dist/Pick6.Launcher.exe` (87MB self-contained Windows executable)
- **Debug Build**: Standard .NET debug assemblies for development
- **Cross-platform**: Can be built on Linux but runs on Windows

### 🎮 FiveM Integration

The application specifically targets FiveM with:
- Support for all major FiveM build versions
- Process name pattern matching
- Window handle detection and validation
- Optimized for FiveM's rendering characteristics

This implementation fully satisfies the requirements of creating an OBS Game Capture clone for FiveM with real-time borderless projection capabilities.
