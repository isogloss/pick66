# Pick6 Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

Pick6 is a complete OBS Game Capture clone specifically designed for FiveM with enhanced Vulkan injection capabilities:

### ✅ Core Requirements Met

1. **Enhanced Game Capture**: Vulkan DLL injection for direct frame capture + GDI fallback
2. **UI with Projection Control**: Interactive console-based UI with enhanced process detection
3. **Borderless Fullscreen Projection**: Native Win32 borderless window implementation
4. **Resolution & Settings Configuration**: Configurable FPS (up to 120), resolution scaling, hardware acceleration
5. **Real-time Frame Projection**: No recording - pure real-time projection like OBS
6. **FiveM-Specific**: Auto-detection with Vulkan process identification
7. **Smart Injection System**: DLL injection with shared memory for high-performance frame transfer

### 🏗️ Architecture

```
Pick6.Launcher.exe (Main executable - 87MB self-contained)
├── Pick6.Core (Capture engine & FiveM detection)
├── Pick6.UI (Interactive console interface)
└── Pick6.Projection (Borderless fullscreen window)
```

### 🚀 Usage Modes

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
Pick6.Launcher.exe
# Shows full menu with 8 options including scan, capture, project, configure
```

**Automated Mode:**
```bash
Pick6.Launcher.exe --auto-start  # Auto-detect and start everything
Pick6.Launcher.exe --fps 30 --resolution 1920 1080
```

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Vulkan Injection**: Direct frame capture through DLL injection into FiveM processes
- **Enhanced Process Detection**: Identifies both traditional and Vulkan-enabled FiveM processes
- **Smart Fallback**: Uses GDI window capture when injection is not available
- **Real-time Capture**: 60 FPS default, configurable up to 120 FPS
- **Borderless Projection**: True fullscreen borderless window (like OBS fullscreen projector)
- **Configuration**: FPS, resolution scaling, hardware acceleration toggle
- **Cross-platform Build**: Builds on Linux, targets Windows for execution
- **Shared Memory**: High-performance frame data transfer between injected DLL and main process

### 🛠️ Technical Details

- **.NET 8**: Modern, high-performance runtime
- **Vulkan API Hooking**: Direct interception of Vulkan presentation calls
- **DLL Injection**: Win32 process injection for frame capture
- **Shared Memory**: High-performance inter-process communication
- **GDI Fallback**: Win32 GDI using BitBlt for compatibility
- **Native Window Creation**: Direct Win32 API calls for borderless projection
- **Multi-threaded**: Separate threads for capture and rendering
- **Memory Optimized**: Proper frame disposal and memory management

### 🔧 Build Output

- **Primary**: `dist/Pick6.Launcher.exe` (87MB self-contained Windows executable)
- **Debug Build**: Standard .NET debug assemblies for development
- **Cross-platform**: Can be built on Linux but runs on Windows

### 🎮 FiveM Integration

The application now provides enhanced FiveM integration with:
- Support for all major FiveM build versions
- Vulkan process detection and targeting
- DLL injection for direct frame access
- Shared memory communication for high-performance data transfer
- Fallback to traditional window capture for compatibility
- Enhanced process monitoring with Vulkan capabilities

This implementation provides significant improvements over traditional window capture methods by accessing frame data directly from the Vulkan rendering pipeline, resulting in lower latency and better performance.
